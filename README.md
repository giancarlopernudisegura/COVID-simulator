Covid 19 will be a pandemic simulator where you play as an all powerful
government official trying to curve the spread of the virus to ultimately
provide a fun and educational challenge to players.

## Features and notes for game
- different factors increase/decrease spread speed (economic, political, health) 
- economic and political stability factors (maybe scores to incentivize replayability)
- population trust towards government
- vaccination research/coverage
- making sure healthcare/other systems don't crash
- random events that player will respond to
- two ways of transmission of virus (frequency, density dependent)
- nation setting, maybe global and fictional down the road
- different levels of difficulty
- virus transmission spread will be modeled after real spread data
- ultimate goal is to flatten curve and avoid disaster for country 
- aimed towards young adults/teens, maybe making a more complex game down the road
